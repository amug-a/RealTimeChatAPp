THis app is called Dozier. Looking to add a database in the future. Maybe electron to turn it into a desktop application. 

## to run:
  1. Go to root dir
  2. have node installed
  3. type "npm run dev" without quotes
  4. go to your browser and type "localhost:3000" in the url bar without the quotes.
  5. Magic.
